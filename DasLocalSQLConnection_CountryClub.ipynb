    "**The objective of this notebook is to illustrate the power of Structured Query Language (SQL)** to solve a few business questions related to a country club. We connect to a local instance of the database containing information about the country club using Python and SQLite in this Juptyer Notebook. Depending on the business question, we retrieve particular pieces of information from the database and translate our requests into SQL queries. The output format of each querry is similar to what we would see in a typical relational database management system software such as `MySQL`. The `sqlite3` module is used here only to access the database and the `pandas` library is used only to format the output of each querry similar to what we would obtain in a standard relational database management system software such as `MySQL`. No data manipulation or analysis is carried out through python. **This notebook exclusively uses SQL querries for data processing and analysis as and when required.**"
